Our location on earth is represented by a small sphere, which could be the 
dome of an astronomical observatory. We can now identify the rotation of 
the earth around itself by the movement of this location.

The dome changes its color based on the time of day: in the night it is blue, 
on sunrise it gets green, at noon it changes to yellow and on sunset it gets 
blue again.

We now come back to our first question: what is exactly a day? 
The answer is: it depends ...
