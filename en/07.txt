An interesting side note

The only light which strikes the earth comes from the sun and therefore
always half of the earth is in darkness. Depending on the relative position
of the earth to the sun (and to our camera) we can see more or less of the 
illuminated half, which leads to the same effect that we know from our moon: 
phases! This time earth phases and not lunar phases.

But now let's move our camera straight upward so that we have a better view 
down to the north pole. We will also replace the earth's equator by a latidude
circle at 51°, which will be used in further calculations ...
