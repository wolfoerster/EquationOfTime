On December 9 the time of noon is 11:52:27 which is followed by 11:52:53 
for the next day. If you calculate the difference on your own, you will come
to a value of 26 seconds, whereas the table shows 27 seconds. But there is
nothing wrong here - it's just that the time values are rounded to the nearest
second but the differences are calculated from the unrounded values.

Let's wait a bit longer to see the funny effect of sunrise and sunset times
that this demo is all about: the earliest sunset happens to be on December 
12 at 15:46:27 and the latest sunrise shows up on December 30 at 08:09:48.
