From this perspective we can identify an important fact: 
the earth's rotation axis does not change while it is orbiting the sun. Just like
a giant spin top the earth keeps rotating around itself in always the same way
(at least nearly, but the small difference does not matter here).

As a result of this the north pole (and a certain region around it) is in darkness 
for half a year (left of the y axis, i.e. autumn and winter), while in the other half
(right of the y axis, i.e. in spring and summer) it is always lit!

Now let's slow down the simulation speed and have a closer look to what is 
happening at our location on earth at 51° in spring ...
