The reason for this strange behaviour is simple but not obvious:
the total length of a day (from one noon to the next) is not 24 hours but varies 
periodically about an average value of 24 hours during a year. 

In December the total length is about 24 hours and 30 seconds, which means
that our clocks will show half a minute later for each noon. And also sunrise 
and sunset are delayed by the same 30 seconds. 

If each day would last exactly 24 hours, we would not see the strange behaviour 
of rise and set times. The shortest day would also be the day of latest sunrise 
and earliest sunset. To understand what's going on here, we need to clarify a 
seemingly dumb question: 

What is a day?
