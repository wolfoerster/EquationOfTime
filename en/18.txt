We can now see another important fact: when the earth has finished a rotation 
around itself, it also has moved a certain amount in its orbit around the sun.
To reach the next noon position, it has to rotate further by the same degree
that makes up this movement.

So the length of time between two noons is the time it takes for the earth to
turn around itself plus the time for the additional rotation to compensate the
movement around the sun. While the first term is a real constant and always 
has a value of 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4 seconds, it is the second term, the 
additional rotation, which varies in the real world.

We now move and attach our camera to the earth again, so it looks like the 
earth is standing still and the sun moves around it ...
