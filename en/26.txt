If the earth is faster as usual, as in winter, it travels a longer distance per time
around the sun as usual. Therefore it has to rotate a bit more as usual until the
meridian catches the sun again. Which makes the total length of a day longer
again. The difference is about 8 seconds in winter.

Likewise in summer the earth is travelling at a slower speed than usual and thus
the days are 8 seconds shorter than usual.

If we add this effect to the previous effect of the axial tilt, our model of the world
is in harmony with nature again. You can see it at the table above ...
