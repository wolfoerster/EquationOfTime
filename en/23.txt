We can now explain what's going on with the times of sunrise and sunset in December: 

The earth is coming near the winter solstice and though the sun rises later each day,
the difference to the rise time the day before gets smaller. Similar the sun sets earlier
every day, but again the difference to the day before gets smaller.

On top of this behaviour there is a daily shift of all times of about 30 seconds towards
the evenings, because the total length of a day in December is about 24 hours and 30 
seconds.

This shift pushes the rise times, even if they are slightly decreasing after the solstice,
still in the evening direction. Until the difference is larger than 30 seconds!

Likewise, when the decrease of set times falls below 30 seconds before the solstice, 
the absolute set times start to increase again. It's getting dark later!

But wait! Did I say 30 seconds? The table above is showing something different ...
