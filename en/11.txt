For a better illustration we have filled the imaginary circle with transparent 
blue color and cut off the half of it which lies beyond the pole axis. Remember
that the disc is perfectly aligned to the north and south direction.

We can now identify the moment when the sun transits the south direction very 
easily: it's when the disc moves right through the sun from right to left.

For the observer on earth it is just the other way round: the disc is standing
still and the sun moves through it from left to right. The name of this imaginary 
disc is 'meridian' from the latin word meridies, which means midday and south.

So let's move our camera down to earth and put it on top of the observatory 
and look straight to the south ...
