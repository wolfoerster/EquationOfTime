This time we did not attach the camera to the observatory at the ground, but
several thousands of kilometres right above the north pole, so we can see the
earth spinning around itself and the sun moving around the earth.

Since our ideal earth is moving on a perfect circle around the sun, it now looks
like the sun is moving on a perfect circle around the earth. And the velocity of
the sun is always the same. Therefore it always takes the same additional amount
for the earth to spin to the next noon. This is done in 3 minutes and 56 seconds,
so when adding the time for a complete rotation, which is 23 hours, 56 minutes
and 4 seconds, we exactly end up with 24 hours.

But this will change drastically, when we restore the axial tilt. For a clearer
illustration we will go for 60° instead of 23° and speed up the simulation ...
