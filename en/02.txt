So why isn't the earliest sunset on the year's shortest day? 
Wouldn't that be most natural?

There can only be one reason for this: the time of sunrise!

And in fact, while the sun sets 5 minutes later on Christmas than on December 12, 
it surprisingly rises 8 minutes later! So the net length of daylight (which is just the 
time span between sunrise and sunset) is 3 minutes shorter.

And the sun keeps going on rising later day by day until December 30. Perhaps
some of you might have noticed that in early January it seems to be most dark
in the morning, whereas in early December it appears most dark in the evening.
