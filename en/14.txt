The time of noon on March 20 is 12:07:12 but a day later it is 12:06:54, 
which is 18 seconds earlier. The same difference shows up for the next days 
but if we wait a bit longer, we can see the value slowly moving towards zero.
For those who cannot wait this long: you can change the speed!

On May 13 the difference is zero, which means that this is one of the rare days, 
which exactly lasts 24 hours. The days before were shorter and the days after will
be longer as you can see from the differences which will be greater zero now.

How does it look like in December?
