And these coordinates do not change much when the sun is apparantly above 
or below the earth, whereas they do so to the left or to the right of the earth.

Remember that the green axis is the spring-autumn axis, so if the sun is apparantly
above the earth, it is spring, whereas it is autumn when the sun is below the earth.
Likewise it is winter when the sun is to the right of the earth, and, yes, it is summer
when the sun is left of it.

So the velocity of the appearant sun changes throughout the year. In spring and
in autumn it is slower than in summer or in winter. But if the sun is slower as
usual, the meridian will catch it earlier as usual, so the time between two noons
is shorter as usual ...
