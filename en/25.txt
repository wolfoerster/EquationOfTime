The difference of the earth's orbit to a circle would be hardly visible to the naked eye,
but even if it is very small, it has a remarkable effect. The major axis of the ellipse is
nearly the same as our x axis and on January 5 the earth is about 5 million kilometres
nearer to the sun than on July 6, when it has reached its furthest point.

Now if the distance gets shorter, the sun's gravitational pull on earth gets stronger.
This leads to an increased speed of the earth in winter and a decreased speed in 
summer.

And what was true for the apparent motion of the sun, which helped to explain the
shift in time caused by the axial tilt, is also true for the real motion of the earth ...
