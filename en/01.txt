This demo is about to inspect a phenomenon that most people are not even aware of:
the Equation of Time.

What everybody in the northern region of the earth is aware of is that in winter the
days are shorter than in summer, or more precisely, the sun rises later and sets earlier. 
And most of us also know that about December 21 we have the shortest day of the year.

This has been a reason to celebrate from ancient times and it is no coincidence 
that Christmas is celebrated just a few days later. I really like winter, but I'm also glad
when days are getting longer again.

Now some time ago I discovered, that there is a reason for joy already nine days earlier,
because December 12 is the day of the earliest sunset! And on Christmas the sun sinks 
below the horizon already 5 minutes later than on this remarkable day.
