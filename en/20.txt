Since our camera ist still fixed to the polar axis of the earth, we do not see the
axial tilt directly, but the sun seems to move on an ellipse now. In fact the sun
is still moving on a perfect circle, but that circle is tilted about 60°, so the
movement goes in and out of the screen. With 3D glasses you would really see 
the sun moving away from you and coming back again.

And now for the most important fact the meridian does not care about if the sun
is behind the screen or in front of it! It only cares about the coordinates of the
sun as it is projected onto the screen ...
