Likewise if the apparant sun is faster as usual, the earth has to rotate a little bit
more as usual for the meridian to catch it. That is why the days are longer than 24
hours in summer and in winter.

So the axial tilt causes our days to be sometimes shorter and sometimes longer
than 24 hours. In fact there are only four days in a year, where it takes exactly 24
hours from one noon to the next.

But now let's come back to a more realistic world, where a year has 365.25 days 
and the axial tilt has a value of 23.44° ...
