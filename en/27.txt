That's it! I hope you enjoyed the show.

If you want to read more about the Equation of Time, take look at these sites:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_time

If you want to verify the calculations of this simulation, go to
https://www.calsky.com/ -or- http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/index.php

On the first site (after switching to English) select 'Sun', then 'Rise and Set'.
You can then enter parameters for the calculation of rise, noon and set times.
On the second site go directly to 'Table of Sunrise/Sunset' (no times for noon).

To compare the numbers enter a latitude of 51° and a longitude of 0°. You will find 
that the numbers indeed are different! Especially for rise and set times. That's because
this simulation is using a rather simple model of the world and does not take into 
account all effects that have an influence on these times, e.g. atmospheric refraction.
