It is midnight and all we see is something blue in the middle of the screen. 
In fact this is the meridian disc as it looks from here and the meridian itself
is an imaginary vertical line right in the middle of the scene.

Wait a moment and soon the sun will rise in the east (which we cannot see
directly because we are looking straight to the south). The simulation will
stop once the sun crosses the meridian.
