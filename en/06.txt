The stick which is going right through the earth represents the axis of the 
earth's daily rotation around its own center. The upper exit point shows the
north pole, while the lower exit point corresponds to the south pole.

Note that the earth's rotation axis is not perpendicular to the plane of the 
ecliptic but is tilted by about 23°. This axial tilt, which is called 'obliquity',
is what causes our seasons.

The angle of obliquity is also visible as the angle between the ecliptic and
the earth's equator.
